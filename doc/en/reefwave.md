# ReefWave:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ReefWave devices are different from other ReefBeat devices. They are the only devices that are slaves to the ReefBeat cloud.<br/>
> When you launch the ReefBeat mobile app, the status of all devices is queried and data from the ReefBeat app is retrieved from device state.<br/>
> For ReefWave, it is the opposite: there is no local control point (as you can see in the ReefBeat app, you cannot add a ReefWave to a disconnected aquarium).<br/>
> <center><img width="20%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elwinmage/ha-reefbeat-component/main/doc/img/reefbeat_rswave.jpg" alt="Image"></center><br />
> Waves are stored in the cloud user library. When you change a wave's value, it is changed in the cloud library and applied to the new schedule.<br/>
> So there is no local mode? Not so simple. There is a hidden local API to control ReefWave, but the ReefBeat app will not detect the changes. As a result, the device and Home Assistant on one side, and the ReefBeat mobile app on the other, will be out of sync. The device and Home Assistant will always be synchronized.<br/>
> Now that you know, make your choice!

> [!NOTE]
> ReefWave waves have many linked parameters, and the range of some parameters depends on other parameters. I was not able to test all possible combinations. If you find a bug, you can create an issue [here](https://github.com/Elwinmage/ha-reefbeat-component/issues).

## ReefWave Modes
As explained above, ReefWave devices are the only devices that can become unsynchronized with the ReefBeat app if you use the local API.
Three modes are available: Cloud, Local, and Hybrid.
You can change the mode by setting the "Connect To Cloud" and "Use Cloud API" switches as described in the table below.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Mode name</td>
<td>Connect To Cloud Switch</td>
<td>Use Cloud API Switch</td>
<td>Behavior</td>
<td>ReefBeat and HA are synchronized</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cloud (Default)</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Data is fetched via the local API. <br />On/off commands are also sent via the local API. <br />Wave commands are sent via the cloud API.</td>
<td>✅</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Local</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>Data is fetched via the local API. <br />Commands are sent via the local API. <br />Device is shown as "off" in the ReefBeat app.</td>
<td>❌</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hybrid</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>Data is fetched via the local API. <br />Commands are sent via the local API.<br />The ReefBeat mobile app does not display the correct wave values if they have been changed via HA.<br/>Home Assistant always displays the correct values.<br/>You can change values from both the ReefBeat app and Home Assistant.</td>
<td>❌</td>
</tr>
</table>

For Cloud and Hybrid modes you must link your ReefBeat cloud account.
First create a ["Cloud API"](../../README.md#add-cloud-api) device with your credentials, and that's it!
The "Linked to account" sensor will be updated with the name of your ReefBeat account once the connection is established.

## Changing current values
To load current wave values into the preview fields, use the "Set Preview From Current Wave" button.

</p>
To change the current wave values, set the preview values and use the "Save Preview" button.

The behavior is the same as the ReefBeat mobile app. All waves with the same ID in the current schedule will be updated.
